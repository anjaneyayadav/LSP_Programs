### üîµ 1. Some App (e.g., `bluetoothctl`)

- This is a **user-space application** that the user runs to control Bluetooth functionality.
- Example: `bluetoothctl` can scan, pair, and connect to Bluetooth devices.
- It **doesn't talk to the driver directly**; it communicates via a service.

---

### üîÅ 2. IPC (e.g., `dbus`)

- The app uses **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)** to communicate with a **Bluetooth service**.
- In Linux, `dbus` is a common IPC mechanism.
- This allows processes to **exchange information securely and efficiently**.
- Think of this like a **messenger** between app and background service.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è 3. Service (e.g., `systemd-bluetooth`)

- A **background system service** that handles Bluetooth operations.
- Runs continuously to manage connections, visibility, discovery, etc.
- Receives commands from apps via IPC (dbus) and delegates them to libraries.

---

### üìö 4. Library (e.g., `bluetooth.c`)

- The service uses **Bluetooth-specific libraries** written in C (like `bluetooth.c`).
- These libraries contain reusable **Bluetooth functions and logic** (e.g., scanning, pairing, etc.).
- Acts as a **middleware** between the service and the core system.

---

### üì¶ 5. C Library (glibc or Bionic)

- These are the **standard C libraries** used by applications and services.
- Functions like `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `ioctl()`, `poll()` are provided here.
- They **wrap around system calls**, making it easier for programmers to write code.

---

### üß† 6. System Call Interface

- The C library uses **Linux system calls** to talk to the **kernel**.
- Example system calls: `open`, `read`, `write`, `ioctl`, `poll`.
- These **bridge user space to kernel space**.

---

### üß© 7. Kernel Drivers (RFCOMM + UART)

#### ‚úÖ RFCOMM Driver:

- Part of the **Bluetooth protocol stack in kernel**.
- Implements the RFCOMM protocol (Bluetooth serial port emulation).
- Enables sending/receiving data like a serial connection.

#### ‚úÖ UART Driver:

- A **hardware-level driver** that communicates over the **serial UART interface** to the Bluetooth chip/module.
- Actual hardware transmission happens here.

---

### üì° 8. Bluetooth Module (Hardware)

- The **physical Bluetooth chip/module** connected via UART (or USB, SPI, etc.).
- Sends/receives Bluetooth signals (radio frequency).
- Handles actual wireless data communication.

## üîΩ 1. Linux Kernel

1. This is the base of Android that directly manages hardware like CPU, memory, and devices.  
2. It includes drivers for camera, audio, Bluetooth, and handles memory, power, and process management.

---

## üü® 2. Native Daemons & Libraries

1. These are background system services and C/C++ based native libraries used for core functionality.  
2. For example, `netd` handles network operations and `SQLite` is used by apps to store data locally.

---

## üü• 3. Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

1. HAL acts as a bridge between the Android OS and hardware components.  
2. It ensures Android works consistently across different hardware like various cameras or sensors.

---

## üîµ 4. Android Runtime (ART)

1. Android Runtime executes app code and manages memory using JIT and AOT compilation.  
2. It runs `.dex` files and automatically performs garbage collection to free unused memory.

---

## üü¶ 5. Android System Services

1. These are essential services like `ActivityManager`, `LocationManager`, and `WindowManager`.  
2. Apps use these services in the background to manage activities, get location, or show windows.

---

## üü© 6. Android Framework

1. This layer provides developers with reusable APIs to build apps using Java or Kotlin.  
2. It contains pre-built components like buttons, views, services, and content providers.

---

## üü™ 7. Applications

1. These are the user-facing apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, or the Phone app.  
2. Apps interact with the Android framework, services, HAL, and kernel to perform their tasks.
