### üîµ 1. Some App (e.g., `bluetoothctl`)

- This is a **user-space application** that the user runs to control Bluetooth functionality.
- Example: `bluetoothctl` can scan, pair, and connect to Bluetooth devices.
- It **doesn't talk to the driver directly**; it communicates via a service.

---

### üîÅ 2. IPC (e.g., `dbus`)

- The app uses **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)** to communicate with a **Bluetooth service**.
- In Linux, `dbus` is a common IPC mechanism.
- This allows processes to **exchange information securely and efficiently**.
- Think of this like a **messenger** between app and background service.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è 3. Service (e.g., `systemd-bluetooth`)

- A **background system service** that handles Bluetooth operations.
- Runs continuously to manage connections, visibility, discovery, etc.
- Receives commands from apps via IPC (dbus) and delegates them to libraries.

---

### üìö 4. Library (e.g., `bluetooth.c`)

- The service uses **Bluetooth-specific libraries** written in C (like `bluetooth.c`).
- These libraries contain reusable **Bluetooth functions and logic** (e.g., scanning, pairing, etc.).
- Acts as a **middleware** between the service and the core system.

---

### üì¶ 5. C Library (glibc or Bionic)

- These are the **standard C libraries** used by applications and services.
- Functions like `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `ioctl()`, `poll()` are provided here.
- They **wrap around system calls**, making it easier for programmers to write code.

---

### üß† 6. System Call Interface

- The C library uses **Linux system calls** to talk to the **kernel**.
- Example system calls: `open`, `read`, `write`, `ioctl`, `poll`.
- These **bridge user space to kernel space**.

---

### üß© 7. Kernel Drivers (RFCOMM + UART)

#### ‚úÖ RFCOMM Driver:

- Part of the **Bluetooth protocol stack in kernel**.
- Implements the RFCOMM protocol (Bluetooth serial port emulation).
- Enables sending/receiving data like a serial connection.

#### ‚úÖ UART Driver:

- A **hardware-level driver** that communicates over the **serial UART interface** to the Bluetooth chip/module.
- Actual hardware transmission happens here.

---

### üì° 8. Bluetooth Module (Hardware)

- The **physical Bluetooth chip/module** connected via UART (or USB, SPI, etc.).
- Sends/receives Bluetooth signals (radio frequency).
- Handles actual wireless data communication.

| 4Ô∏è‚É£   | **WakeLocks**                   | **WakeLock API is available** ‚Äì apps can keep CPU/screen awake              | **No WakeLock API** ‚Äì system sleep needs to be managed manually             |
| 5Ô∏è‚É£   | **IPC Mechanism**               | Uses **Binder IPC** ‚Äì fast, secure, client-server communication (RPC style) | Uses **System V IPC** ‚Äì includes pipes, message queues, shared memory       |
| 6Ô∏è‚É£   | **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)** | Strong **HAL layer** ‚Äì provides standardized interface to hardware         | **No dedicated HAL** ‚Äì applications access hardware directly (via `/dev`)   |
